# Streamlit Network Packet Analyzer

This is a Python-based project that captures network packets and displays real-time graphs of their behavior using Streamlit.

## Description

The Streamlit Network Packet Analyzer is a tool that captures network packets and visualizes their behavior in real-time. It uses the Scapy library to capture packets and the Matplotlib library to plot the graphs. The captured packets' sizes are plotted over time to provide insights into the network traffic.

## Features

- Captures network packets and analyzes their behavior.
- Displays a real-time graph of packet sizes over time.
- Provides an interactive and user-friendly interface with Streamlit.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

2. Install the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8501/`) to access the Streamlit app.

## Usage

1. Once the Streamlit app is running, it will start capturing network packets and displaying the real-time graph.

2. Interact with the Streamlit app by observing the packet sizes and their behavior on the graph.

3. You can stop the Streamlit app by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or command prompt.
